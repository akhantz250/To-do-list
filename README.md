# To-do List

Todo list app inspired by the Todoist website. Here is my [Live Demo](https://akhantz250.github.io/To-do-list/)

This project is an assignment from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) curriculum.

### Features

#### Projects:

Users can create projects to group similar tasks. Projects can be navigated to through the sidebar menu.

#### Views:

- Inbox is the main view which shows all tasks.
- Today view shows all tasks due today.
- Upcoming view sorts all tasks with due dates in ascending order.

#### Tasks:

Users can add, edit, view, mark done and delete tasks.

#### Storage:

Data saved in localstorage.

### Tools

Tools used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Webpack.

### Review

This project was a good exercise to practice object oriented design principles and patterns:

- Single responsiblility, loosely-coupled objects and open-closed principles.
- Factory functions and module pattern.

Obviously I still need more practice to write more organized code.
